# Morning Briefing Template

When generating a morning briefing, include:

1. **Calendar** — Today's events from mcp-calendar (list_events for today)
2. **Tasks** — Pending scheduled tasks (clawnix_list_scheduled)
3. **Directives** — Active standing directives (clawnix_directive_list)
4. **System** — Server uptime and status (clawnix_system_status)

Keep it concise. Use bullet points. Prioritize actionable items.
